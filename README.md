# PMMKD: A Progressive Multilevel Mixing-based Knowledge Distillation Framework for Enhancing 3D Object Detection on Compressed Point Clouds

We present CPC-3DOD, a compressed point cloud dataset for 3D object detection, comprising five levels of compression and the associated degradations impacting object detection tasks.
* To the best of our knowledge, CPC-3DOD dataset is the ﬁrst distortion point cloud dataset for 3D point cloud object detection, which allows for supervised training of advanced detectors.
* Our CPC-3DOD dataset is established from the widely-used KITTI and nuScenes public datasets in the field of autonomous driving, giving rise to CPC-KITTI and CPC-nuScenes, respectively. These datasets comprise diverse point cloud scenes.
*  Our CPC-3DOD dataset features five levels of compression and the associated degradations affecting object detection tasks, comprehensively reflecting real-world scenarios.
*  Our CPC-3DOD dataset exhibit diverse properties, including various back-ground, Car, Pedestrian, Cyclist, bus, etc.
*  Due to the complete annotation of the raw data, CPC-3DOD dataset inherits the original annotations through our compression method, thus facilitating further research.
